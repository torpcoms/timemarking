Unlike the Jeff Stuecheli presentation, this one is more about the IBM system than the processor itself.

## First Power 9 System and PowerAI
*The slides and video download links are on [the AIX VUG wiki](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#/wiki/Power%20Systems/page/AIX%20Virtual%20User%20Group%20-%20USA), if you are reading this in the future, you'll have to scroll down or `ctrl` + `F` to it; its full heading is **December 12, 2017 - First Power 9 System and PowerAI - with Chris Mann**, even though the first two slide decks are by Joel Dodd.*

### Timemarkers
***Disclaimers:** Slide 19 is shown while they continue talking about CORAL contracts, the time shown is for the start of 6-GPU design discussion. "Nutanix" is a guess, its a bit hard to hear them. "Dodd" as Joel's last name is also a guess.*

### Interesting Notes
Summit/Sierra supercomputer delivery completion is expected in June 2018. 1000 nodes delivered so far to each. IBM is shipping 100 nodes per day.

Aurora supercomputer using x86 was was delayed.

Crysis 3 is not a POWER9 benchmark
